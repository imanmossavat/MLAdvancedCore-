# MLAdvancedCore

## **Overview**
Over the past 15 years, I have explored and worked with a wide range of concepts in mathematics, statistics, and machine learning. Among them, I’ve identified a set of key ideas that are both fundamental and advanced:

- **Fundamental**: These concepts are like the elements of a periodic table—core building blocks that underlie many modern machine learning techniques.
- **Advanced**: They often don’t appear as the first topics you encounter when entering the field. Their depth and utility become apparent only after moving beyond the basics.

This repository, **MLAdvancedCore**, is my effort to distill these concepts into digestible summaries, paired with accessible code examples and visualizations. My aim is to bridge the gap between theory and practice, helping others understand not just *what* these methods are but *why* they matter.

## **Topics Covered**
1. **Bayesian Theorem**: Understanding probabilities, updating beliefs, and quantifying uncertainty.
2. **Maximum Entropy**: Making fair assumptions while modeling distributions under constraints.
3. **Free Energy**: Approximation techniques that transform intractable inference into optimization problems.
4. **Exponential Family**: A unifying framework for many probability distributions and their sufficient statistics.
5. **Proximal Operators**: Tools for solving non-smooth optimization problems efficiently.
6. **Kernels**: Transforming data into high-dimensional spaces for non-linear modeling.
7. **Graph Laplacians**: Capturing the structure of graphs for clustering, dimensionality reduction, and beyond.
8. **Bellman Equations**: The foundation of reinforcement learning and sequential decision-making.

## **Why This Matters**
These topics have stood the test of time because they offer:
- **Timeless Relevance**: Applicable across disciplines and domains, from physics to finance.
- **Theoretical Rigor**: They provide a strong mathematical foundation for modern ML algorithms.
- **Practical Utility**: These methods are often indispensable when working with real-world data and challenges.

## **Getting Started**
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/MLAdvancedCore.git
   cd MLAdvancedCore
   ```
2. Install dependencies:

   Each topic has its own folder containing a markdown file (overview), Jupyter notebooks (code), and images.

## **Acknowledgements**
This repository reflects years of learning, practice, and iteration. It’s a living document, and I welcome feedback, contributions, and discussions to improve it further.
