# MLAdvancedCore

- December 2024: This is work under construction. I am going to gradually add topics over time. I find myself relying too much on developed libraries, so I decide to write these notes to remind myself. 

## **Overview**
Over the past years, I have explored and worked with a wide range of concepts in mathematics, statistics, and machine learning. Among them, I’ve identified a set of key ideas that are both fundamental and advanced.

This repository, **MLAdvancedCore**, is my effort to distill these concepts into digestible summaries. 

## **Topics Covered**
1. **Bayes Theorem**: Understanding probabilities, updating beliefs, and quantifying uncertainty.
2. **Maximum Entropy**: Making fair assumptions while modeling distributions under constraints.
3. **Exponential Family**: A unifying framework for many probability distributions and their sufficient statistics.
4. **Free Energy**: Approximation techniques that transform intractable inference into optimization problems.
5. **Proximal Operators**: Tools for solving non-smooth optimization problems efficiently.
6. **Kernels**: Transforming data into high-dimensional spaces for non-linear modeling.
7. **Graph Laplacians**: Capturing the structure of graphs for clustering, dimensionality reduction, and beyond.
8. **Bellman Equations**: The foundation of reinforcement learning and sequential decision-making.
9. **Random Matrices**: Spectral properties of random matrices
10. **Emergence and Criticality**: How more is different and what it means for statistical methods 

## **Acknowledgements**
This repository reflects years of learning, practice, and iteration. It’s a living document, and I welcome feedback, contributions, and discussions to improve it further.
